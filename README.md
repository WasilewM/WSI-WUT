# WSI-WUT  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code in this repository was written during Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course of my computer science studies at WUT.  
In this repository I only upload finished code, due to the fact that I do work with the gitlab repository of the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology on a daily   basis.

Task 1 - gradient descent - write code that finds a local minimum of 2 hardcoded functions.  
Task 2 - evolution algorithm - write evolution algorithm that finds a local minimum of th bird function:

Task 3 - Tic Tac Toe mini-max algorithm - write mini max algorithm with alpha-beta cutting that will play Tic Tac Toe  
Task 4 - Naive Bayesian Classifier - write Naive Bayesian classifier that will predict wine  classes. Use dataset from link below:

Task 5 - Neural Network - implement Neural Network with single hidden layer - draft done in cooperation with @ianczyko  
Task 6 - Reinforcement learning - implement Q-learing algorithm that will allow agent to learn to move around given labirynt and achieve goal / finish field  
Task 7 - Bayesian Models - implement bayesina network generator that will produce "random" samples consistent with conditional probabilities distribution
